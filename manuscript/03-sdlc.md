# Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC)

Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software industry to design, develop, test, and deploy software.

In most cases, the phases uses as SDLC are as follows:

* Defining (requirements)
* Planning
* Designing
* Development
* Testing
* Deployment
* Repeat

The major difference between different organization is how long is one of those cycles. In the waterfall model, one project would have only one SDLC cycle. If a project is a year long, months (or at least weeks) would be spent in each of those phases.

Agile models splits a project into multiple iterations (sprints). Durations of those iterations vary from organization to organization and can be anything from a week to four weeks. Each iteration would repeat the whole SDLC cycle.

Organizations that adopt DevOps and continuous delivery or deployment, often shorten the cycle to a few days, hours, or even minutes.

It is important to understand that, in some cases, the phases of the cycle might overlap. It is not uncommon to have a longer planning session at the beginning of a sprint and than repeat it every day (15 minutes stand-up). Some teams apply emergent design efectivelly merging this phase with development.

The order of some phases might be reverted. For example, when test-driven development is used, automated tests are written before development (coding) and iterations between testing and coding is much shorter (often measured in minutes).

No matter the duration and the order of SDLC phases, all are present in a formal or informal way.
